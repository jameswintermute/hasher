About
=====
A project by James Wintermute, jameswinter@protonmail.ch. Started December 2022.

Purpose
=======
The point of this project is the following:

- Create a sha1 hash of all files on a NAS drive, users home dir.
- Store this and use it as a point of reference in disk rotation to spot significant amounts of file change
- Ransomware and Malware are increasingly destructive and how would a user identify if many of their files had been corrupted or destroyed
- Allow the file to be ingested into a SIEM tool such as Splunk

Secondary purpose
=================
For spotting duplicate files across a filesystem, an additional module may be required for this element


Future expansion
================
